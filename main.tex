\begin{frame}{Differential Privacy}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Two \textcolor{blue}{neighbor} datasets $X$, $\acute{X}$ only differ in one element
    \item Algorithm F is \textcolor{blue}{$\epsilon$-differentially private} if for any two neighbor datasets ($X$, $\acute{X}$) and for all possible outputs we have: 
    
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{Pr[F(X)=w]}{Pr[F(\acute{X})=w]}\leqslant e^{\epsilon}
    \end{equation*}
    
    \item Example: If person $P_i$ \textcolor{red}{changed their input} from $g$
    to $\acute{g}$, the \textbf{relative probabilities
    of any output} \textcolor{blue}{do not change by much}.
    \item \textbf{Theorem (post-processing):} Assume $\mathcal{D}:\mathbb{N}^{|\mathcal{X}|} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a randomized algorithm which is $\epsilon$-differentially private and $\mathcal{G}:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R'}$ is an arbitrary randomized mapping.~Then $\mathcal{G} \circ \mathcal{D}:\mathbb{N}^{|\mathcal{X}|} \rightarrow \mathbb{R'}$ is $\epsilon$-differentially private as well~\cite{dwork2014algorithmic}.
    
\end{itemize}


\end{frame} 


\begin{frame}{Renyi Differential Privacy}

\begin{definition}[Renyi divergence of order $\alpha$]\label{def:rd}

The Rényi divergence of order $\alpha$ of a distribution $P$ from the distribution $Q$ is defined as below:

$$D_\alpha(P||Q)=\frac{1}{\alpha - 1} log \left (E_{Q(x)}\left ( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \right )^{\alpha}\right )$$ 

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Renyi Differential Privacy~(RDP)]\label{def:rdp}

The randomized algorithm $\mathcal{A}: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{U}$ is $(\alpha,\epsilon)$-RDP if for all neighbor databases $X$ and ${X}'$ we have:

$$D_\alpha(\mathcal{A}(X)||\mathcal{A}({X}')) \leq \epsilon$$

\end{definition}


\end{frame} 


\begin{frame}{RDP Properties}

 \begin{proposition}[Composition of RDP]\label{def:rdp-p1}
 
 If $\mathcal{A}: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{U}_1$ is $(\alpha,\epsilon_{1})$-RDP and $\mathcal{B}: \mathcal{U}_1 \times \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{U}_2$ is $(\alpha,\epsilon_{2})$-RDP, then the mechanism $(\mathcal{M}_1,\mathcal{M}_2) $, where $\mathcal{M}_1 \sim \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{X})$ and $\mathcal{M}_2 \sim \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{M}_1,\mathcal{X})$ satisfies the $(\alpha,\epsilon_{1}+\epsilon_{2})$-RDP conditions.$\blacktriangle$

\end{proposition}

 \begin{proposition}\label{def:rdp-p2}
 If the mechanism $\mathcal{A}: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{U}$ is $(\alpha,\epsilon)$-RDP then it also obeys $(\epsilon + \frac{log(1/\delta)}{(\alpha-1)}),\delta)$-DP for any $0 < \delta < 1$.$\blacktriangle$

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Convolutional Autoencoder}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We use a \textit{One Dimensional Convolutional Autoencoder~(1D-CAE)}, amis to:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item capture the correlation between neighboring features
        \item represents a new compact feature space
        \item transform the possible discrete records to a new continuous space
        \item simultaneously model discrete and continuous which is a know issue in the SDG literature
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item GAN architecture is designed to handle both discrete and continuous values
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:bce}
BCE:-\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i}^{m}\left ( x_i log(\hat{x}_i) + (1- x_i) log(1 - \hat{x}_i) \right )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:mse}
MSE:\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \left |x_i - \hat{x}_i \right |^2
\end{equation}



\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Convolutional GAN (Discriminator \& Generator)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item One-Dimentional Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (1D-CGANs)
    
    \item Improving power of generative model $\rightarrow$ Using \textcolor{blue}{Wasserstein GAN}~\cite{arjovsky2017wasserstein}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Wasserstein distance}}: Represents minimum price in transforming generated data distribution $\boldsymbol{P_g}$ to real data distribution $\boldsymbol{P_r}$
    \begin{equation*} \label{eq:KR}
    W(\mathbb{P}_r, \mathbb{P}_\theta) = \sup_{\|f\|_L \leq 1} E_{x \sim \mathbb{P}_r}
    [f(x)] - E_{x \sim \mathbb{P}_g}[f(x)]
    \end{equation*}
    
    Supremum is over all 1-Lipschitz functions
    \item \textcolor{red}{Advantages:} \textbf{(1)} No mode collapse reported; \textbf{(2)} Understandable workflow
    \item \textcolor{red}{Hypothesis}: More realistic results
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{How to Calculate Privacy Loss?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tracking RDP privacy accountant~\cite{abadi2016deep} is \textcolor{blue}{computationally more precise} than the regular DP
    \item The noise additive procedure is also called \textit{Sampled Gaussian Mechanism~(SGM)}
    \item How do we calculate the $(\alpha,\epsilon)$-RDP for the \textit{\textcolor{red}{combination} of autoencoder and GAN training?}
    \item The \textbf{Composition of RDP} proposition directly results in having the \textcolor{red}{whole system} with $(\alpha,\epsilon_{ae}+\epsilon_{gan})$
\end{itemize}



\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{SGM privacy loss}

\begin{theorem}[SGM privacy loss]

Assume $D$ and $D'$ are two neighbor databases and $\mathcal{G}$ is a SGM applied to a function $f$ with $\ell_{2}$-sensitivity of one.~If we set the following:

$$\mathcal{G}(D) \sim \varphi_{1} \overset{\Delta}{=} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$$
$$\mathcal{G}(D') \sim \varphi_{2} \overset{\Delta}{=} (1-q)\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2) + q \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$$


where $\varphi_{1}$ and $\varphi_{2}$ are PDFs, then, the mechanism $\mathcal{G}$ satisfies $(\alpha,\epsilon)$-RDP for:

$$\epsilon \leq \frac{1}{\alpha - 1} log(max\left \{ A_\alpha,B_\alpha \right \})$$

where $ A_{\alpha} \overset{\Delta}{=} \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \varphi_{1}}\left [ \left ( \varphi_{2} / \varphi_{1} \right )^\alpha \right ]$ and $ B_{\alpha} \overset{\Delta}{=} \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \varphi_{2}}\left [ \left ( \varphi_{1} / \varphi_{2} \right )^\alpha \right ]$. $\blacktriangle$

\begin{frame}{General Considerations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We split the dataset into a train $\mathcal{D}_{tr}$ and a test set $\mathcal{D}_{te}$
    \item All the reported $\epsilon$ are associated with the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP definition with $\delta=10^{-5}$, unless otherwise stated
    \item We report models' evaluations under the differentially private setting (changing $\epsilon$)
\end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Unsupervised Setting: Setup}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We use binary discrete datasets with $\mathcal{D}_{tr} \in \{0,1\}^{R \times |\mathcal{T}|}$, $\mathcal{D}_{te} \in \{0,1\}^{T \times |\mathcal{T}|}$, and $\mathcal{D}_{syn} \in \{0,1\}^{S \times |\mathcal{T}|}$
    \item $|\mathcal{T}|$ represents the feature size
    \item The goal is to capture the information of a data and synthesize a dataset similar to the real private data
    \item \textbf{Dataset.} We use \textit{MIMIC-III} dataset~\cite{johnson2016mimic} that consists the medical records of around 46K patients.

        \item The rest of the dimensions~($\mathcal{S}_{syn, \backslash k} \in \{0,1\}^{N \times T-1}$ and $\mathcal{S}_{tr, \backslash k} \in \{0,1\}^{N \times T-1}$) are used to train two classifiers
